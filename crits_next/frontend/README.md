# CRITs Next Frontend

This directory contains a minimal React application bootstrapped with Vite. It communicates with the GraphQL backend using Apollo Client.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with your preferred package manager and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and expects the backend running at `http://localhost:8000`.
