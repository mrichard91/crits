# CRITs Next

This directory contains an experimental rewrite of CRITs using modern technologies. The goal is to create a Python 3.12+ backend powered by FastAPI and GraphQL with a React-based frontend.

## Structure

- `backend/` – FastAPI project exposing a basic GraphQL endpoint.
- `frontend/` – React application bootstrapped with Vite.

Both sides are intentionally minimal to provide a starting point for further development.
